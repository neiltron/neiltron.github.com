> In Holland, we have two words for design. One is vormgeving; in German
formgeben. And the other word is ontwerpen; in German entwurf. In the Anglo-
Saxon language there’s only one word for design, which is design. That is
something you should work out. Vormgeving is more to make things look nice. So
for instance, packaging for a perfume or for chocolate in order to make things
fashionable, obsolete and therefore bad for society because we don’t really
need it. While ontwerpe means, and the Anglo-saxon word, but its stronger,
means engineering. That means you as a person try to invent a new thing—which
is intelligent, which is clever, and which will have a long-life. And that’s
called stylistic durability. It means you can use it for a long time.
